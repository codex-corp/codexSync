"""One rule for "does this directory entry point somewhere else".

Three readers walk trees they must not leave — a project being moved, the
`.codex` copy, the session catalogue — and each used to answer this on its
own. ``is_symlink()`` misses a Windows junction, so a walk that trusted it
followed `.codex/skills` into folders outside `.codex`; "any reparse point"
catches the junction but also every cloud placeholder, which is an ordinary
file or folder whose content reads like any other.

What separates a link is the name-surrogate bit Windows sets on every reparse
tag that names another location (symlinks, junctions, WSL links). Placeholders
of Yandex.Disk and OneDrive (``IO_REPARSE_TAG_CLOUD_*``, ``0x9000xxxx``) lack
it. Only when the tag cannot be read is a reparse point assumed to be a link,
because then nothing proves it is not. ``os.path.isjunction`` exists only from
Python 3.12, so the attribute test is what carries 3.11; elsewhere the stat
result has no Windows attributes and only a symlink is a link.
