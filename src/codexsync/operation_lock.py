    """A non-stealable lock; file age is never used to break ownership.

    One lock per (state root, machine) for *every* mutation family (CS-304).
    ``family`` used to be part of the key, which let `chats move` and
    `repair-projects apply` -- or a sync and a restore -- run at the same
    time with only the journal's non-atomic check between them, and the later
    writer silently replaced what the earlier one wrote. ``family`` is kept for
    the refusal message only.

    ``reentrant=True`` lets the *same thread* enter the lock again while the
    outer holder is inside, without taking anything new: `recover rollback`
    holds it across closing a journal and the restore that follows, and that
    restore opens the same lock itself. Without the flag a nested attempt is
    refused like any other, and another thread or process always is.
